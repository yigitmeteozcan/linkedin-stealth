# stealth-watch

Track when LinkedIn people go stealth or change positions. VC deal scourcing. Runs free on GitHub Actions. No API keys. No servers.

---

## How it works

- Reads a list of LinkedIn profiles from `profiles.csv`
- Queries Google for each profile's current title and snippet (never touches LinkedIn directly)
- Flags changes that match stealth startup patterns: founder keywords, blank titles after senior roles, etc.
- Writes findings to `results.md` and commits them automatically every 48 hours

---

## Quick start

1. **Fork** this repo
2. **Edit** `profiles.csv` — add the people you want to watch
3. **Done** — GitHub Actions runs every 48 hours and updates `results.md`

To trigger a run immediately: Actions → Stealth Watch → Run workflow.

---

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tracker.py
```

Results are written to `results.md` and `state.json`.

## How stealth detection works

A profile is flagged as **STEALTH** if any of the following is true:

1. The current title or snippet contains a stealth keyword (`founder`, `building`, `new venture`, `kurucu`, etc.)
2. The title went blank or passive (`open to work`, `between roles`, etc.) AND the previous title was senior-level (`Director`, `VP`, `Head of`, `CTO`, etc.)

**Confidence levels:**
- `high` — stealth keyword found directly in the title
- `medium` — title went blank and person was previously senior
- `low` — keyword found in snippet only

Keep your `profiles.csv` private — it reveals who you are watching.
Do not commit it to a public fork.
